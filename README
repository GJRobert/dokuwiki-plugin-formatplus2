====== Formatting+ Syntax ======

There are many plugins that provide additional XHTML formatting for
DokuWiki. But the syntax isn't always consistent or compatible with
other plugins. I believed the best solution is a unified plugin.

===== Usage =====

A drop-down menu containing shortcuts for all the formatting styles
is added to the edit toolbar.

The inline formatting syntax is as follows:

^     Style    ^   Syntax   ^    XHTML Tag            ^
|     Variable | %%??..??%% | VAR                     |
|   Definition | %%@@..@@%% | DFN                     |
|     Citation | %%&&..&&%% | CITE                    |
|     Keyboard | %%``..``%% | KBD                     |
|     Citation | %%$$..$$%% | SAMP                    |
|  Superscript | %%/^..^/%% | SUP                     |
|    Subscript | %%/,..,/%% | SUB                     |
|       Insert | %%/+..+/%% | INS CLASS=simple        |
|       Delete | %%/-..-/%% | DEL CLASS=simple        |
|      Inverse | %%/!..!/%% | EM CLASS=inverse        |
|   Small-Caps | %%!!..!!%% | STRONG CLASS=smallcaps  |
|        Quote | %%""..""%% | Q                       |

There are three block formats:

^      Style    ^       Syntax                      ^    XHTML Tag               ^
|  Block Insert | %%<ins title =cite @date></ins>%% | INS CLASS=block            |
|  Block Delete | %%<del title =cite @date></del>%% | DEL CLASS=block            |
|   Block Quote | %%<quote cite></quote>%%          | BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=citation  |

The block insert and delete styles will also wrap the text in a ''DIV''
block with the class name ''inserted'' or ''deleted''. XHTML requires
this to determine whether the tag is being used inline or as a block.

The block styles, as well as the inline quote style, can have attributes.
All attributes are optional. For inline quotes, the cite attribute can
be specified like this: %%""=cite|..""%%

The included stylesheet is intended for browsers that fully support CSS2.
This does not include Microsoft Internet Explorer, however. The plugin
outputs a JavaScript function that uses DHTML to compensate.

===== Configuration =====

The plugin allows you to disable individual styles. In the configuration
manager, select the formatting styles that you do not want to use.
If the option ''classic_del'' is selected, then DokuWiki's default
block delete will be used when there are no attributes, but the syntax
with attributes will be handled by the plugin.

The editor buttons are added in a sub-menu of the toolbar. If the ''toplevel''
option is set, then buttons are shown in the main toolbar.

to do something nice for me, please consider dropping a few clams in
